How much will it cost?
How will it scale?
What possible future issues are anticipated?

### 3.3 Cost analysis

What is the cost to run the solution per day?
What does it cost to roll it out? 

### 3.4 Security considerations

What are the potential threats?
How will they be mitigated?
How will the solution affect the security of other components, services, and systems?

### 3.5. Privacy considerations

Does the solution follow local laws and legal policies on data privacy?
How does the solution protect users’ data privacy?
What are some of the tradeoffs between personalization and privacy in the solution?

### 3.6 Regional considerations

How will operational costs be kept low while delivering increased value to the users? 

### 3.9 Risks

What risks are being undertaken with this solution?
Are there risks that once taken can’t be walked back?
What is the cost-benefit analysis of taking these risks? 

### 3.10. Support considerations

How will the support team get across information to users about common issues they may face while interacting with the changes?
How will we ensure that the users are satisfied with the solution and can interact with it with minimal support?
Who is responsible for the maintenance of the solution?
How will knowledge transfer be accomplished if the project owner is unavailable?
