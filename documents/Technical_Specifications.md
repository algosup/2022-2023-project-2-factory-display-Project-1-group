## Project Description

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview, Problem Description, Summary, or Abstract

JACOBI's Group is world leader in purification solution of air and water, using Activated Carbon, Ion Exchange Resins and Mobile Filtration Units. With its factory in Forges industrial zone since 1956, it has a heritage of being the only French industry manufacturing this unique product and supplying customers like Veolia, Valeo, Honeywell and French Ministry of Defence to name a few. There are over 1000 applications in which activated carbon is used which you can get more information on www.jacobi.net
The factory in Vierzon is the oldest in the Group however one of the most successful thanks to a flexible and can-do approach.
The Managing Director of JACOBI's in France, Mr Saeed is constantly seeking ways to improve his management. One of his favourite subjects, which is also the one for which he receives most feedback, is communication.
Communication – updated, accurate and transparent. The short and sweet wishlist!
One of the many ways to achieve this is to digitalise the communication of the Company and make it easy to publish the content. Currently, factory news and important announcements are done by email to groups, on MS Teams Groups, Yammer, etc. However, of the 64 factory staff, only around half of the aforementioned have Company email addresses. Displaying paper format information is outdated and in a huge factory of 8 hectares, it is not efficient.

### 1.2. Context or Background

The problem of the JACOBI's Group is the communication with their employees. They want to improve the communication between the employees and the management. They want to make the communication more efficient and more transparent.
This problem can affects the employees and the management. The employees can be more informed about the company and the management can be more efficient. It's can also affect the company goals because the employees can be more motivated and the management can be more efficient.
The product can help the team to achieve their goals. The team can be more efficient and the communication can be more transparent.
The solution can fit into the overall product roadmap and strategy because the product can help the team to achieve their goals.
The solution can fit into the technical strategy because the product can help the team to achieve their goals.

### 1.3. Goals or Product and Technical Requirements

The product requirements are:

- The employees can be more informed about the company.
- The management can be more efficient.
- The employees can be more motivated.

The technical requirements are:

- The product must be easy to use.
- The product must be easy to install.
- The product must be easy to maintain.

### 1.4 Non-Goals or Out of Scope

The product and technical requirements that will be disregarded are:

- Nothing for the moment.

### 1.5 Future Goals

We could add some need widgets in the future , or stuff that the industry needs.

### 1.6 Assumptions

The conditions and resources that need to be present and accessible for the solution to work as described are:

- The Website must be accessible to the client to be able to use the product.
- The Application needs to be accessible on google play to be able to install it on the client's TV.
- The Database needs to work to be able to store the data and redirect it to the application.

## 2. Solutions

### 2.1 Current or Existing Solution / Design

We are going to use a Smart TV with Google TV application to display the information. The Smart TV is a good solution because it's easy to use and it's easy to install. It's also a good solution because it's easy to maintain. We will have an application to be able to display information on the Smart TV. We will also have a website for administrators to be able to change the information on the Smart TV. The editing of the information must be easy to use because the administrators are not technical people.

### 2.2 Test

The test will be done when we will get the first version, and we will ask directly the client to get a real feedback.

### 2.3 Monitoring

The logging plan is :

- Use the authentification system of Supabase to be able to log the users.

The observability is:

- We need to take care of the fact that sometimes there are visitors in the factory and they can see the information on the Smart TV. So the display needs to be different for the employees and the visitors.

### 2.4. Release / Roll-out and Deployment Plan

The deployment architecture is:

- Do all the work neccessary to upload the app on google play.
- Create the database and set it up (Authentification, Linking, etc.).

### 2.5 Rollback Plan

For employees or the staff who missed the information, the information will be available on the database.
We will upload every information on the database, so it will be easy to rollback or just show the information missed to the concerned people.

## 3. Further Considerations

### 3.1 Impact on other teams

It will increase the work of other people, because the product will give information to the employees and make them feel more informed about the company.

### 3.2 Third-party services and platforms considerations

It's really worth it compared to building the service in-house because the product will give information to the employees and make them feel more informed about the company.

The security and privacy concerns associated with the services/platforms are:

- Authentification and authorization.
- All the data will be stored on the database.

How much it will cost :

It will cost the price of the Smart TV.(Around 500.00€, depending on the size of the Smart TV).

How it will scale :

It will scale with the number of Smart TV.

The possible future issues are:

- Version which can change on the Smart TV.
- Problem with the connection between the Smart TV and the Internet.

### 3.3 Cost analysis

The cost to run the solution per day is:

- Only the price of the electricity use by the TV.
- The maintenance of the TV if it's necessary.

The cost to roll it out :

  Only the price of the Smart TV.

### 3.4 Security considerations

The potential threats are:

- People who can acces to the TV and change the displayed information.
- People who can acces to the database and change the information.
- people who can acces to the database and delete the information.
- People who can acces to the database and access to personal information.

### 3.5. Privacy considerations

The solution follow local laws and legal policies on data privacy.
The solution protect users’ data privacy.
The tradeoffs between personalization and privacy in the solution are:

- The personalization is the information displayed on the Smart TV.
- The privacy is the personal information of the company.

### 3.6 Regional considerations

The impact of internationalization and localization on the solution is:

- The information displayed on the Smart TV will be in the language of the country, so here it will be in french.

### 3.7. Operational considerations

The solution doesn't cause adverse aftereffects.
The data will be store in a database, that can be useful with someone miss an information.

### 3.8 Risks

The risks are:

- Be out of date.
- Not be able to show everything that we want to do for the v1.

### 3.9. Support considerations

The support team will get across information to users about common issues they may face while interacting with the changes.
The users will be satisfied with the solution and can interact with it with minimal support.
The maintenance of the solution will be done by the product owner.
The knowledge transfer will be done by the product owner.

## 4. Success Evaluation

### 4.1 Impact

The security impact is:

- The security of the database.
- The security of the Smart TV.

### 4.2. Metrics

The metrics to capture are:

- The number of people who use the Smart TV.
- The number of people who use a computer to change or add information.

## 5. Work

### 5.1. Work estimates and timelines

For the work estimation, timelines and milestones, we use Trello to manage the tasks.
Refer to the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/h4SIY75N/2022-2023-project-2-factory-display-project-1-group) board for more details.

### 5.2. Future work

The tasks that will be completed in the future are:

- Add more information on the Smart TV.
- Add the Authentification and authorization.

## 6. Deliberation

### 6.1 Discussion

The elements of the solution that members of the team do not agree on and need to be debated further to reach a consensus are:

- Raspberry PI or Smart TV.
- The design of the product.
- Application or application + website.
- The information to display on the product.
- MySQL, Firebase, MongoDB or Supabase.

### 6.2 Open Questions

The questions about things you do not know the answers to or are unsure that you pose to the team and stakeholders for their input are:

- How to make the Smart TV display the information.
- How to make the Smart TV display the information in a good way.

## 7. End Matter

### 7.1 Related Work
