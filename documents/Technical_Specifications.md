## Project Description

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview, Problem Description, Summary, or Abstract

Jacobi Group is world leader in purification solution of air and water, using Activated Carbon, Ion Exchange Resins and Mobile Filtration Units. With its factory in Forges industrial zone since 1956, it has a heritage of being the only French industry manufacturing this unique product and supplying customers like Veolia, Valeo, Honeywell and French Ministry of Defence to name a few. There are over 1000 applications in which activated carbon is used which you can get more information on @ www.jacobi.net
The factory in Vierzon is the oldest in the Group however one of the most successful thanks to a flexible and can-do approach.
The Managing Director of Jacobi in France, Mr Saeed is constantly seeking ways to improve his management. One of his favourite subjects, which is also the one for which he receives most feedback, is communication.
Communication – updated, accurate and transparent. The short and sweet wishlist!
One of the many ways to achieve this is to digitalise the communication of the Company and make it easy to publish the content. Currently, factory news and important announcements are done by email to groups, on MS Teams Groups, Yammer, etc. However, of the 64 factory staff, only around half of the aforementioned have Company email addresses. Displaying paper format information is outdated and in a huge factory of 8 hectares, it is not efficient.

The current solution description is:

- Use a Smart TV to display the information.
- Give an access to someone to change the information on the Smart TV.
- The editing of the information must be easy to use.

We are going to use a Smart TV to display the information. The Smart TV is a good solution because it's easy to use and it's easy to install. It's also a good solution because it's easy to maintain. We'll have an application to be able to display information on the Smart TV. We will also have a website for administrators to be able to change the information on the Smart TV. The editing of the information must be easy to use because the administrators are not technical people.
